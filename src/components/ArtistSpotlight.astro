      <h3 class="spotlight-title">Terror Cactus: Desert Bloom of Noise-Pop</h3>
      <p class="spotlight-intro">
        Forget the cacti you know. Terror Cactus, hailing from the sun-baked
        landscapes of Arizona, isn't about prickly exteriors. Instead, they're a
        blooming oasis of noise-pop, injecting a healthy dose of fuzz and melody
        into the arid indie scene.

        Their Bandcamp page is a treasure trove of lo-fi gems, each track a
        sun-drenched postcard from a world where distortion is a virtue and
        catchy hooks are king. Think early Jesus and Mary Chain meets a DIY
        spirit, with a dash of desert psychedelia thrown in for good measure.

        Terror Cactus crafts songs that are both abrasive and strangely
        comforting, like finding shade under a thorny bush on a scorching day.
        If you're craving something raw, honest, and dripping with reverb, dive
        into the prickly paradise that is Terror Cactus. You might just find
        your new favorite sonic bloom.
